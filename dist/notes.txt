improvements I need to make:
	Fix the bug where if 8 creeps surround the spawn the game hangs.
		Could be done using a queue, where spawn has 6 open spots. When a creep wants to access spawn it needs to check if spawn has open spots
		Another way to do this is to prevent loitering at spawn. Store the Game.time of entry and force exit if Game.

	Storage of energy will need to be optimized.
		Energy needs to be stored in spawn only when there is less than 300 energy in it.
		Energy should be stored in extensions when spawn has 300 energy.
		Energy should be stored in containers when extensions are full
		Energy should be harvested from containers first, then extensions, then spawn


	Each creep should store it's state in memory.

	Each individual creep should change it's state based on the state of the other creeps.


	To optimize cpu usage I will create a module to run and store things once and then import them to the other modules



Simple goals for tonight.
	Clean up files
	Get back to prev state
